# Hints from CS50AI lecture --------------------
# For each knowledge base, youâ€™ll likely want to encode two different types of information: 
# (1) information about the structure of the problem itself (i.e., information given in the definition of a Knight and Knave puzzle), 
# (2) information about what the characters actually said.

# Translation to current contexts -----------------
# 1.1 Each character is either a knight or a knave.
# 1.2 Every sentence spoken by a knight is true, and every sentence spoken by a knave is false.
# 2. statements given in each puzzle

# Puzzle 0
# A says "I am both a knight and a knave."
knowledge0 = And(
    # TODO
    # 1.1 A either knight or knave but not both
    Or(AKnight, AKnave), 
    Biconditional(AKnight, Not(AKnave)),

    # 1.2 A is knight if statement is true.
    Biconditional(AKnight, And(AKnight, AKnave))
)

# Puzzle 1
# A says "We are both knaves."
# B says nothing.
knowledge1 = And(

    # 1.2

# Puzzle 2
# A says "We are the same kind."
# B says "We are of different kinds."
knowledge2 = And(
    # TODO

# Puzzle 3
# A says either "I am a knight." or "I am a knave.", but you don't know which.
# B says "A said 'I am a knave'."

# C says "A is a knight."
