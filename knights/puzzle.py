# Hints from CS50AI lecture --------------------
# For each knowledge base, youâ€™ll likely want to encode two different types of information:
# (1) information about the structure of the problem itself (i.e., information given in the definition of a Knight and Knave puzzle),
# (2) information about what the characters actually said.

# Translation to current contexts -----------------
# 1.1 Each character is either a knight or a knave.
# 1.2.1 Every sentence spoken by a knight is true,
# 1.2.2 Every sentence spoken by a knave is false.
# 2. statements given in each puzzle

# Puzzle 0
# A says "I am both a knight and a knave."
knowledge0 = And(
    # TODO
    # 1.1 A either knight or knave but not both (aka XOR)
    Or(AKnight, AKnave),
    Biconditional(AKnight, Not(AKnave)),

    # 1.2.1 A is knight if statement is true.
    Biconditional(AKnight, And(AKnight, AKnave))
)

# Puzzle 1
# A says "We are both knaves."
# B says nothing.
knowledge1 = And(
    # TODO

    # 1.1 person is either knight or knave but(and) not both (aka XOR)
    And(
        Or(AKnight, AKnave),

    ),
    And(
        Or(BKnight, BKnave),
        Not(And(BKnight, BKnave))
    ),

    # 1.2.1
    Biconditional(AKnight, And(AKnave, BKnave)), # IFF A is knight if his statement true (A is knave and B is Knave)

    # if A is Knight, A cannot be Knave (1.1)
    # but if A is not Knave, A's statement is false (1.2)
    # so A is not a Knight
    # Hence A is a Knave (1.3) ==> statement is false ==> Not(And(AKnave, BKnave))
    # Not(And(AKnave, BKnave)) == Or(Not(AKnave), Not(BKnave))
    # from 1.3 Not(AKnave) is false ==> Or(Not(AKnave), Not(BKnave)) = Not(BKnave)
    # hence B is Knight
